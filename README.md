#### Intro

`wgpu` is a crate implementing the WebGPU specification in Rust. It's primary backends are Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal.

#### Goals

wgpu-mc is a standalone, mostly-batteries-included rendering engine written in Rust.
Electrum is a fabric mod that integrates wgpu-mc with Minecraft.

#### Current status

Both the engine and Electrum are both currently under active development.
wgpu-mc is fairly mature, while Electrum needs more development. The whole project is 
WIP, so something may work one day then be rewritten the next.
Terrain rendering works somewhat, while entities are still entirely un-integrated in Electrum.
A publicly testable release of the mod should be out Soonish.
